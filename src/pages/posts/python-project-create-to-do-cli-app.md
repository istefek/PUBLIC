# Python Project - Create A To-Do Cli App

Published on: 2024-08-18

Welcome to another _new techtutorial_. In continuing with our learning python series, this techtutorial shows you just how cool python is to create useful little apps that make you productive. In this post, we look at how east it is to create a useful cli to-do app to help keep you on top of your projects, tasks, or any other requirement that needs special attention in your life.

## The Steps In A Nutshell

1. **Installing Python**: First, If you haven't already, make sure you have Python installed before you attempt this coding TechTutorial project. If you need to install Python, then follow _How To Install Python To Start Coding_ first before continuing with this TechTutorial.

2. **First - Describe an outline for your cli app**: Before you start coding any python cli `app`, you first need to outline what your app is to achieve. Doing this helps you to be better organised making your app be as bug free as possible so this section shows you how to create a quick outline document and store it within your project folder at location: `outline/document/` folder.

3. **Second - Create your project folder**: In this section, we create the project folder that will house our Python project files. Its important that you don't skip this section.

## What's next

This TechTutorial will be finished soon. I will keep adding more sections soon. Watch this space for more to come.
